## Overview
Hello Delon,

I hope this message finds you well.

This repository contains a demonstration of a potential solution tailored to address the processes and challenges you are currently handling, especially those related to updating database storage and obtaining user information.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a foundational framework to help solve the main challenges that **Think Technologies** is currently facing. The code included in this demonstration is designed to be a practical starting point for managing and automating database updates, storing user data, and maintaining seamless interactions with user information.

## Key Features
- Automated user information updates and storage.
- Integration with backend systems for streamlined database management.
- Structured and scalable code that can be easily expanded or customized.

1. **Configuration**:
   - Set up your MongoDB connection in the `config/db.js` file.
   - Update any environment variables as needed.

2. **Running the Application**:
   - Start the server using:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     node app.js
     ```
   - Access the API via `http://localhost:3000` (default port).

## How It Works
The code is structured to receive user data, process it, and update the database automatically when new user information is provided. It is designed with scalability in mind, making it adaptable to future enhancements or additional features.

## Next Steps
This demonstration can be used as a framework for further development. I encourage you to test the solution, integrate it with existing systems, and expand upon it to fully meet your company's needs.

Thank you, and I look forward to your feedback and any further discussions!

Best regards,  
Ken
